The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It encapsulates the data and
provides methods for manipulating and accessing it.
The View is responsible for displaying the application's user interface. It presents the data from the
  Model to the user and captures user input.
The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from
the View, updates the Model accordingly, and instructs the View to display any changes in the Model.
  By using the MVC pattern, applications become more modular, maintainable, and scalable. It
promotes code reusability, separation of concerns, and easy collaboration within development teams.
